### Analysis
---
The film's subject matter and thematic merit have been lauded, receiving critical praise and discourse. It depicts Death as a living antagonist, chasing Puss for his final life. Puss does not defeat Death by combat, however, but instead by learning to accept the inevitability of death, while making sure to live life to the fullest and learning to let the people he loves have a part in his life. This metaphor has received critical evaluation and appraisal for its poignancy.
